            CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more
            complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can
            help. Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like
            variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other nifty goodies that
            make writing CSS fun again.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed
            Sass file and save it as a normal CSS file that you can use in your
            website.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal. Once
            Sass is installed, you can compile your Sass to CSS using the sass
            command. You'll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and
            where to output CSS to. For example, running sass input.scss
            output.css from your terminal would take a single Sass file,
            input.scss, and compile that file to output.css.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can also watch individual files or directories with the --watch
            flag. The watch flag tells Sass to watch your source files for
            changes, and re-compile CSS each time you save your Sass. If you
            wanted to watch (instead of manually build) your input.scss file,
            you'd just add the watch flag to your command, like so:
          </p>

          <pre><code>sass --watch input.scss output.css</code></pre>

          <p>
            You can watch and output to directories by using folder paths as
            your input and output, and separating them with a colon. In this
            example:
          </p>

          <pre><code>sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets</code></pre>

          <p>
            Sass would watch all files in the app/sass folder for changes, and
            compile CSS to the public/stylesheets folder.

        <article>
          <p>
            Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to
            reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors,
            font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass
            uses the $ symbol to make something a variable. Here's an example:
          </p>

          <div class="code-panels">
            <div class="panel">
              <span>SCSS</span>
              <pre>
          <code class="scss">$font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
  font: 100% $font-stack;
  color: $primary-color;
}</code>
</pre>
            </div>

            <div class="panel">
              <span>CSS</span>
              <pre>
          <code class="css">body {
  font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;
  color: #333;
}</code>
          </pre>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            When the Sass is processed, it takes the variables we define for the
            $font-stack and $primary-color and outputs normal CSS with our
            variable values placed in the CSS. This can be extremely powerful
            when working with brand colors and keeping them consistent
            throughout the site.
          </p>

          <div class="info">
            <span>Fun fact:</span>
            <p>
              Sass variables, like all Sass identifiers, treat hyphens and
              underscores as identical. This means that $font-size and
              $font_size both refer to the same variable. This is a historical
              holdover from the very early days of Sass, when it only allowed
              underscores in identifier names. Once Sass added support for
              hyphens to match CSS’s syntax, the two were made equivalent to
              make migration easier.

          <p>
            When writing HTML you've probably noticed that it has a clear nested
            and visual hierarchy. CSS, on the other hand, doesn't.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sass will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the
            same visual hierarchy of your HTML. Be aware that overly nested
            rules will result in over-qualified CSS that could prove hard to
            maintain and is generally considered bad practice.
          </p>

          <p>
            With that in mind, here's an example of some typical styles for a
            site's navigation:
          </p>

          <div class="code-panels">
            <div class="panel">
              <span>SCSS</span>
              <pre>
          <code class="scss">nav {
  ul {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
  }

  li { display: inline-block; }

  a {
    display: block;
    padding: 6px 12px;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
}</code>
          </pre>
            </div>

            <div class="panel">
              <span>CSS</span>
              <pre>
          <code class="css">nav ul {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}
nav li {
  display: inline-block;
}
nav a {
  display: block;
  padding: 6px 12px;
  text-decoration: none;
}</code>
          </pre>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            You'll notice that the ul, li, and a selectors are nested inside the
            nav selector. This is a great way to organize your CSS and make it
            more readable.

        <article>
          <p>
            You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of
            CSS that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to
            modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. A
            partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might
            name it something like _partial.scss. The underscore lets Sass know
            that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be
            generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the @use
            rule.

        <header>Modules</header>

        <article>
          <p>
            You don't have to write all your Sass in a single file. You can
            split it up however you want with the @use rule. This rule loads
            another Sass file as a module, which means you can refer to its
            variables, mixins, and functions in your Sass file with a namespace
            based on the filename. Using a file will also include the CSS it
            generates in your compiled output!
          </p>

          <div class="code-panels">

          </pre>
              <pre>
          <code class="scss">// styles.scss
@use 'base';

.inverse {
  background-color: base.$primary-color;
  color: white;
}</code>
          </pre>

            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            Notice we're using @use 'base'; in the styles.scss file. When you
            use a file you don't need to include the file extension. Sass is
            smart and will figure it out for you.

            Some things in CSS are a bit tedious to write, especially with CSS3
            and the many vendor prefixes that exist. A mixin lets you make
            groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your
            site. You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible.
            A good use of a mixin is for vendor prefixes. Here's an example for
            transform.
          </p>

          <div class="code-panels">
            <div class="panel">
              <span>SCSS</span>
              <pre>
          <code class="scss">@mixin transform($property) {
  -webkit-transform: $property;
  -ms-transform: $property;
  transform: $property;
}
.box { @include transform(rotate(30deg)); }</code>
          </pre>
            </div>

            <div class="panel">
              <span>CSS</span>
              <pre>
          <code class="css">.box {
  -webkit-transform: rotate(30deg);
  -ms-transform: rotate(30deg);
  transform: rotate(30deg);
}</code>
          </pre>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            To create a mixin you use the @mixin directive and give it a name.
            We've named our mixin transform. We're also using the variable
            $property inside the parentheses so we can pass in a transform of
            whatever we want. After you create your mixin, you can then use it
            as a CSS declaration starting with @include followed by the name of
            the mixin.

        <article>
          <p>
            This is one of the most useful features of Sass. Using @extend lets
            you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. It
            helps keep your Sass very DRY. In our example we're going to create
            a simple series of messaging for errors, warnings and successes
            using another feature which goes hand in hand with extend,
            placeholder classes. A placeholder class is a special type of class
            that only prints when it is extended, and can help keep your
            compiled CSS neat and clean.
          </p>

          <div class="code-panels">
            <div class="panel">
              <span>SCSS</span>
              <pre>
          <code class="scss">/* This CSS will print because
%message-shared is extended. */
%message-shared {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
  color: #333;
}

/* This CSS won't print because
%equal-heights is never extended. */
%equal-heights {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.message {
  @extend %message-shared;
}

.success {
  @extend %message-shared;
  border-color: green;
}

.error {
  @extend %message-shared;
  border-color: red;
}

.warning {
  @extend %message-shared;
  border-color: yellow;
}</code>
          </pre>
            </div>

            <div class="panel">
              <span>CSS</span>
              <pre>
          <code class="css">/* This CSS will print because
%message-shared is extended. */
.message, .success, .error, .warning {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
  color: #333;
}

.success {
  border-color: green;
}

.error {
  border-color: red;
}

.warning {
  border-color: yellow;
}</code>
          </pre>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            What the above code does is tells .message, .success, .error, and
            .warning to behave just like %message-shared. That means anywhere
            that %message-shared shows up, .message, .success, .error, &
            .warning will too. The magic happens in the generated CSS, where
            each of these classes will get the same CSS properties as
            %message-shared. This helps you avoid having to write multiple class
            names on HTML elements.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can extend most simple CSS selectors in addition to placeholder
            classes in Sass, but using placeholders is the easiest way to make
            sure you aren't extending a class that's nested elsewhere in your
            styles, which can result in unintended selectors in your CSS.
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that the CSS in %equal-heights isn't generated, because
            %equal-heights is never extended.

            Doing math in your CSS is very helpful. Sass supports a handful of
            useful operators for working with different values. These include
            the standard mathematical operators like + and *, as well as
            operators for various other types:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>== and !=</code> are used to check if two values are the
              same.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>+, -, *, /, and %</code> have their usual mathematical
              meaning for numbers, with special behaviors for units that matches
              the use of units in scientific math.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code> <, <=,>, and >= </code> check whether two numbers are
              greater or less than one another.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>and, or, and not</code> have the usual boolean behavior.
              Sass considers every value “true” except for false and null.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>+, -, and /</code> can be used to concatenate strings.
            </li>
          </ul>

            <span>Fun fact:</span>
            <p>
              Early on in Sass’s history, it added support for mathematical
              operations on colors. These operations operated on each of the
              colors’ RGB channels separately, so adding two colors would
              produce a color with the sum of their red channels as its red
              channel and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              This behavior wasn’t very useful, since it channel-by-channel RGB
              arithmetic didn’t correspond well to how humans perceive color.
              Color functions were added which are much more useful, and color
              operations were deprecated. They’re still supported in LibSass and
              Ruby Sass, but they’ll produce warnings and users are strongly
              encouraged to avoid them.

            We've created a very simple fluid grid, based on 960px. Operations
