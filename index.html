                CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more
                complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can
                help. Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like
                variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other nifty goodies that
                make writing CSS fun again.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed
                Sass file and save it as a normal CSS file that you can use in your
                website.
            </p>

            <p>
                The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal. Once
                Sass is installed, you can compile your Sass to CSS using the sass
                command. You'll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and
                where to output CSS to. For example, running sass input.scss
                output.css from your terminal would take a single Sass file,
                input.scss, and compile that file to output.css.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can also watch individual files or directories with the --watch
                flag. The watch flag tells Sass to watch your source files for
                changes, and re-compile CSS each time you save your Sass. If you
                wanted to watch (instead of manually build) your input.scss file,
                you'd just add the watch flag to your command, like so:
            </p>

            <pre><code>sass --watch input.scss output.css</code></pre>

            <p>
                You can watch and output to directories by using folder paths as
                your input and output, and separating them with a colon. In this
                example:
            </p>

            <pre><code>sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets</code></pre>

            <p>
                Sass would watch all files in the app/sass folder for changes, and
                compile CSS to the public/stylesheets folder.

        <article>
            <p>
                Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to
                reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors,
                font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass
                uses the $ symbol to make something a variable. Here's an example:
            </p>

            <div class="code-panels">
                <div class="panel">
                    <span>SCSS</span>
                    <pre>
          <code class="scss">$font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
  font: 100% $font-stack;
  color: $primary-color;
}</code>
</pre>
                </div>

                <div class="panel">
                    <span>CSS</span>
                    <pre>
          <code class="css">body {
  font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;
  color: #333;
}</code>
          </pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                When the Sass is processed, it takes the variables we define for the
                $font-stack and $primary-color and outputs normal CSS with our
                variable values placed in the CSS. This can be extremely powerful
                when working with brand colors and keeping them consistent
                throughout the site.
            </p>

            <div class="info">
                <span>Fun fact:</span>
                <p>
                    Sass variables, like all Sass identifiers, treat hyphens and
                    underscores as identical. This means that $font-size and
                    $font_size both refer to the same variable. This is a historical
                    holdover from the very early days of Sass, when it only allowed
                    underscores in identifier names. Once Sass added support for
                    hyphens to match CSS’s syntax, the two were made equivalent to
                    make migration easier.

            <p>
                When writing HTML you've probably noticed that it has a clear nested
                and visual hierarchy. CSS, on the other hand, doesn't.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sass will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the
                same visual hierarchy of your HTML. Be aware that overly nested
                rules will result in over-qualified CSS that could prove hard to
                maintain and is generally considered bad practice.
            </p>

            <p>
                With that in mind, here's an example of some typical styles for a
                site's navigation:
            </p>

            <div class="code-panels">
                <div class="panel">
                    <span>SCSS</span>
                    <pre>
          <code class="scss">nav {
  ul {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
  }

  li { display: inline-block; }

  a {
    display: block;
    padding: 6px 12px;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
}</code>
          </pre>
                </div>

                <div class="panel">
                    <span>CSS</span>
                    <pre>
          <code class="css">nav ul {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}
nav li {
  display: inline-block;
}
nav a {
  display: block;
  padding: 6px 12px;
  text-decoration: none;
}</code>
          </pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                You'll notice that the ul, li, and a selectors are nested inside the
                nav selector. This is a great way to organize your CSS and make it
                more readable.

        <article>
            <p>
                You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of
                CSS that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to
                modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. A
                partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might
                name it something like _partial.scss. The underscore lets Sass know
                that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be
                generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the @use
                rule.

            <p>
                You don't have to write all your Sass in a single file. You can
                split it up however you want with the @use rule. This rule loads
                another Sass file as a module, which means you can refer to its
                variables, mixins, and functions in your Sass file with a namespace
                based on the filename. Using a file will also include the CSS it
                generates in your compiled output!
            </p>

}</code>
          </pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Notice we're using @use 'base'; in the styles.scss file. When you
                use a file you don't need to include the file extension. Sass is
                smart and will figure it out for you.

            <p>
                Some things in CSS are a bit tedious to write, especially with CSS3
                and the many vendor prefixes that exist. A mixin lets you make
                groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your
                site. You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible.
                A good use of a mixin is for vendor prefixes. Here's an example for
                transform.
            </p>

            <div class="code-panels">
                <div class="panel">
                    <span>SCSS</span>
                    <pre>
          <code class="scss">@mixin transform($property) {
  -webkit-transform: $property;
  -ms-transform: $property;
  transform: $property;
}
.box { @include transform(rotate(30deg)); }</code>
          </pre>
                </div>

                <div class="panel">
                    <span>CSS</span>
                    <pre>
          <code class="css">.box {
  -webkit-transform: rotate(30deg);
  -ms-transform: rotate(30deg);
  transform: rotate(30deg);
}</code>
          </pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                To create a mixin you use the @mixin directive and give it a name.
                We've named our mixin transform. We're also using the variable
                $property inside the parentheses so we can pass in a transform of
                whatever we want. After you create your mixin, you can then use it
                as a CSS declaration starting with @include followed by the name of
                the mixin.

        <article>
            <p>
                This is one of the most useful features of Sass. Using @extend lets
                you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. It
                helps keep your Sass very DRY. In our example we're going to create
                a simple series of messaging for errors, warnings and successes
                using another feature which goes hand in hand with extend,
                placeholder classes. A placeholder class is a special type of class
                that only prints when it is extended, and can help keep your
                compiled CSS neat and clean.
            </p>

            <div class="code-panels">
                <div class="panel">
                    <span>SCSS</span>
                    <pre>
          <code class="scss">/* This CSS will print because
%message-shared is extended. */
%message-shared {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
  color: #333;
}

/* This CSS won't print because
%equal-heights is never extended. */
%equal-heights {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.message {
  @extend %message-shared;
}

.success {
  @extend %message-shared;
  border-color: green;
}

.error {
  @extend %message-shared;
  border-color: red;
}

.warning {
  @extend %message-shared;
  border-color: yellow;
}</code>
          </pre>
                </div>

                <div class="panel">
                    <span>CSS</span>
                    <pre>
          <code class="css">/* This CSS will print because
%message-shared is extended. */
.message, .success, .error, .warning {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
  color: #333;
}

.success {
  border-color: green;
}

.error {
  border-color: red;
}

.warning {
  border-color: yellow;
}</code>
          </pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                What the above code does is tells .message, .success, .error, and
                .warning to behave just like %message-shared. That means anywhere
                that %message-shared shows up, .message, .success, .error, &
                .warning will too. The magic happens in the generated CSS, where
                each of these classes will get the same CSS properties as
                %message-shared. This helps you avoid having to write multiple class
                names on HTML elements.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can extend most simple CSS selectors in addition to placeholder
                classes in Sass, but using placeholders is the easiest way to make
                sure you aren't extending a class that's nested elsewhere in your
                styles, which can result in unintended selectors in your CSS.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that the CSS in %equal-heights isn't generated, because
                %equal-heights is never extended.

                Doing math in your CSS is very helpful. Sass supports a handful of
                useful operators for working with different values. These include
                the standard mathematical operators like + and *, as well as
                operators for various other types:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>== and !=</code> are used to check if two values are the
                    same.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>+, -, *, /, and %</code> have their usual mathematical
                    meaning for numbers, with special behaviors for units that matches
                    the use of units in scientific math.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code> <, <=,>, and >= </code> check whether two numbers are
                    greater or less than one another.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>and, or, and not</code> have the usual boolean behavior.
                    Sass considers every value “true” except for false and null.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>+, -, and /</code> can be used to concatenate strings.

                    Early on in Sass’s history, it added support for mathematical
                    operations on colors. These operations operated on each of the
                    colors’ RGB channels separately, so adding two colors would
                    produce a color with the sum of their red channels as its red
                    channel and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This behavior wasn’t very useful, since it channel-by-channel RGB
                    arithmetic didn’t correspond well to how humans perceive color.
                    Color functions were added which are much more useful, and color
                    operations were deprecated. They’re still supported in LibSass and
                    Ruby Sass, but they’ll produce warnings and users are strongly
                    encouraged to avoid them.

                In our example we're going to do some simple math to calculate
                widths for an aside & article.
            </p>

            <div class="code-panels">
                <div class="panel">
                    <span>SCSS</span>
                    <pre>
          <code class="scss">.container {
  width: 100%;
}

article[role="main"] {
  float: left;
  width: 600px / 960px * 100%;
}

aside[role="complementary"] {
  float: right;
  width: 300px / 960px * 100%;
}</code>
          </pre>
                </div>

                <div class="panel">
                    <span>CSS</span>
                    <pre>
          <code class="css">.container {
  width: 100%;
}

article[role="main"] {
  float: left;
  width: 62.5%;
}

aside[role="complementary"] {
  float: right;
  width: 31.25%;
}</code>
          </pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                We've created a very simple fluid grid, based on 960px. Operations
                in Sass let us do something like take pixel values and convert them
                to percentages without much hassle.
